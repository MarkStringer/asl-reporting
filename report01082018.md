# Summary as of 1st August 2018

# Sprint 13 - Mid Sprint

## What's Blocking us / Issues
* We are still waiting for final sign-off on contract renewal for the current system 

## Just Done
* User research carried out with licensing team on inbox and workflow for amendemnts to establishment premises
* Produced design ideas for user account creation, account permissions and PIL application
* Built database migration system

## About to Do/Doing
* Continue to prepare protype designs for User Research with PILs
* Design workflows for the addition/amendment of named people on licences
* Develop working software for user onboarding journeys

## Things to be aware of
* Sadly one of our designers will be leaving the team on 22nd August 
* Two new developers will be joining the team (one will start Monday 6th, the other Monday 13th)
* The overall risk score (see link below) has reduced. The addition of new developers to the team is viewed as reducing the likelihood that we will not be able to turn off the existing system in August 2019
