# Summary as of 2nd May 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* The data exporting functionality in ASPeL cannot be used reliably. Suppliers have said they will not give us access to their database. We need a way to access the underlying data from ASPeL to import it into our systems for private beta.
* Access to Jira was restricted due to the site requiring VPN access which took several days to get working/trouble shoot

## Just Done
* Presented three personas at show and tell (Establishment Admin User, Licensing Office, Inspect)
* Presented the Animals in Science Licensing Ecosystem map
* Demonstrated a working software prototype that allows modification of the schedule of premised using the upload of a csv 

## About to Do/Doing
* Developing the functionality that will constitute the working software used in private beta
* Continuing user research on amendment journeys for PELs and PILs
* Design and user research for a view of named people to be included in the private beta 

## Things to be aware of
* The ASL deliver team will move back into Lunar house, probably at the beginning of June
* There will be continuing user research with licensing officers and researchers in this sprint
