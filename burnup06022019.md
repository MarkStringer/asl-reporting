## Note about the burnup chart

Last week we re-estimated the complexity of the items that are still incomplete in the product backlog.

The resulting burn-up chart "moved" from pointing to project completion in November 2019 to December 2019.

Since the accuracy of such charts is always going to be very rough, the information we are taking, both from the previous estimation and the new estimation is that the project is predict to complete in Q4 2019 when it needs to complete in Q3 2019. The team will continue to focus on reducing scope so that delivery in Q3 2019 is still possible.
