## Just Done
* completed round two of user testing of compliance flags, completed analysis - research and design
* feature: added notification banners for due / overdue ROPs - working software
* fix: Prevent table renderer ignoring empty cells. This resulted in tables containing empty cells to have content in the same row be shifted to the left - working software
* improvement: general constraints are now shown in application downloads (PDF / Word) - working software
* fix: tables in protocol steps had white text on white background, making them impossible to read - working software
* improvement: it is now much more obvious that tables which are larger than the available width can be scrolled horizontally - working software

## About to Do/Doing
* final changes to compliance flags based on user feedback â€“ design
* improvement: clearer content for tasks which did not require approval by ASRU - working software
* improvement: add a "last updated" timestamp to billing contact/PO data - working software
* improvement: improve security scanning of dependencies to allow fine-grained configuration of whitelisted advisories - working softare
