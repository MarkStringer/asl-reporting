## Just Done
* Completed round two of user testing of compliance flags, completed analysis - research and design
* Feature: added notification banners for due / overdue ROPs - working software
* Fix: prevent table renderer ignoring empty cells. This resulted in tables containing empty cells to have content in the same row be shifted to the left - working software
* Improvement: general constraints are now shown in application downloads (PDF / Word) - working software
* Fix: tables in protocol step description field had white text on white background, making them impossible to read - working software
* Improvement: it is now much more obvious that tables which are larger than the available width can be scrolled horizontally - working software

## About to Do/Doing
* Final changes to compliance flags based on user feedback â€“ design
* Improvement: clearer content for tasks which did not require approval by ASRU - working software
* Improvement: add a "last updated" timestamp to billing contact/PO data - working software
* Improvement: improve security scanning of dependencies to allow fine-grained configuration of whitelisted advisories - working software
