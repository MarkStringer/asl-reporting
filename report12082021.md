## Weekly summary
This week we continued to address issues identified with the new Returns of Procedures (ROPs) entry and review software. 

We also reviewed designs for PPL assessment with members of ASRU. We are also preparing for a technical design authority meeting on Wednesday 18th August.

## Just Done
* Design review of the ROPs submission process in ASPEL to check designs are correct and make small refinements to page layouts
* Designing content for the downloads section of the PPL overview to make it easier for ASRU and establishments to see historical versions of licences and applications
* Allow establishment admins to download a list of submitted ROPs (hidden until release agreement) - working software
* Fixed issue with ROPs species selector displaying duplicate species - working software
* Allow multiple “other” ROPs subpurposes to be added - working sofware

## About to Do/Doing
* Design review of ROPs reviewing process (for ASRU) and the data dashboards (for stats team) to check all designs are correct
* Clearing search results on advanced project search - design
* Minor improvements to PPL assessments - design
* Removing references to SPOC in ASRU to reflect the new process - design
