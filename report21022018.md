# Summary as of 21st February 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Lack of access to Lunar House because of some members of the team are waiting for security clearance is still an impediment. This has been addressed by the acquisition of temporary accommodation in Landsdowne Road - just a few minutes from Lunar House.

# Just Done
* Created wireframes and concept designs for prototypes to be tested with selected users next week
* Data schema for establishment licences
* Drafted data migration plan
* Created proof of concept migration tools to migrate data exports from ASPeL into our databases
* Survey has been sent out to Establishments to provide baseline KPIs - so far 26% percent of establishments have responded

## About to Do/Doing
* Research with selected participants will take place this week and next week
* Work will continue to build out our data migration prototype
* We will carry out further research to understand establishment roles and their relationship to training and personal licences
* Looking to grow the team

## Things to be aware of
* This is week 8 that the team has been working together
