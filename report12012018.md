# Summary as of 5th January 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Still finding our feet with regard to the tempo of planning user sessions/ allowing time for reflection and iteration

## Just Done
* User study sessions completed in Edinburgh and Birmingham (total of 14 participants): example feedback "very good rapport and good baland with a lot of opportunities for us to be involved"
* Access to Jira
* Home office email accounts
* Permanent desk space in Lunar House confirmed for the team
* The team talked to Matti Keltanen - HO service designer
* Built continuous integration pipeline
* Set up deployment namespace in ACP (Application Container Platform)
* Created set of re-usable govuk themed React components

## About to Do/Doing
* User Study sessions at the Crick and Kings College (Monday, Tuesday)
* Capturing of findings from user sessions and decisions on next steps

## Things to be aware of
* It's hard to believe that this was only our 2nd week (next Tuesday is day 11)
* Terry Ma, interaction designer, starts work with the team next week
* Aspasia will be mostly unavailable for the next two weeks
* We probably need some thinking time to fully digest what we've learned from user studies
