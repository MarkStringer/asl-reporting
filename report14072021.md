# Summary as of Wednesday 14 July 2021 

# Sprint 88 (ulysses butterfly)

## Weekly summary
We are continuing to put the finishing touches to the RoPs submission process. There are a few known issues that we are working through over the coming weeks. A final release date for this functionality will be formally announced by ASRU. The design team is looking at ways to reduce repetition in in the protocols section of PPLs. Designs have tested well with PPL applicants, and we are working on designs for ASRU inspectors.
Our new Product Manager will be starting on Monday 19th June. Our existing product manager will remain available to support the transition.

## Just Done
* Briefed Research Ops to update the digital consent form so that it follows best practice HO guidance - user research
* Set up a research session with two inspectors on Monday 19th July to get feedback on reusable steps designs - user research
* Create guidance to say that certificates more than 5 years old will not be accepted - content design
* Initial designs for inspectors view of repeated steps - design
* Added various missing columns into the ROPs export - working software
* False/empty answers now display differently in the ROPs export (0 for false) - working software

## About to Do/Doing
