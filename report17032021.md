## Weekly summary
The delivery team has been very small this week, and those still working have been focused on our RoPs delivery plan, along with the usual fixing of bugs as they arise. Our RoPs delivery plan is on track, and ASRU will soon be able to begin testing the submission process.

## Just done
 * First operational newsletter distributed through a list of subscribers managed within ASPeL. In line with GDPR users can now self-manage
 * Fixed an issue that had arisen within the rich text editors PPL applicants use when writing their application. This was reported by one user, although it may have affected many more - working software
 * PPL holders are now told what the mandatory PPL training modules are when drafting their applications. This should reduce the number of PPL applications submitted from applicants without the requisite training - working software
 * Updated licence fee information for the next financial year. Establishments can now check their records and alert ASRU to any discrepancies
 * Reasons for RA are now shown on the RA submission forms. This information will soon be added to the digital and PDF views of the completed RA
 * Built first iteration of establishment facing ROPs submission journey - working software

## About to Do/Doing
 * Release version of ROPs submission for internal testing - working software
 * Build initial iteration of ROPs data export - working software
