* Lack of access to Lunar House because of some members of the team are waiting for security clearance is still an impediment. Some progress has been made. Currently 1 of 4 team members awaiting clearance has gained it. 

# Just Done

* Commenced work on Inspector-oriented - UI and API
* Conducted User Research with design prototypes  with 1 commercial org and 5 universities of various sizes
* User research in a further 12 organisations has been arranged
* Content design on prototypes
* Established Project board - to manage project project alignment, communications, scope and risk

## About to Do/Doing
* Iterating on the design prototype in light of findings from recent studies
* Conducting research in two locations
* Developing a communications strategy
