## Note about the burnup chart
The trajectory of the burnup chart is now showing that we will complete the work before the August 2019 deadline. However projections can fluctuate quite a lot. This chart assumes that progress will be linear but of course we may encounter issues that slow progress.

Weâ€™ll monitor the projected dates over the coming few months, while at the same time looking to make optimisations to the requirements and delivery to allow us to keep the projection on course for August 2019.

The whole point of the burn-up chart is to keep us focussed on controlling scope and give us chance to make any changes that we need to make to deliver on time.

We would like to have implemented most of the functionality by June 2019 to allow for private and public beta testing.
