## Note about the burnup chart
The trajectory of the burnup chart is currently showing past when we need it to be.It’s very early in the burnup process with only a few data points, so the projections can fluctuate quite a lot.

This also assumes that progress will be linear and we will likely get better at delivering, so it's probably a pessimistic view.

We’ll monitor the projected dates over the coming few months, while at the same time looking to make optimisations to the requirements and delivery to allow us to keep the projection on course for August 2019.

The whole point of the burn-up chart is to keep us focussed on controlling scope and give us chance to make any changes that we need to make to deliver on time.
