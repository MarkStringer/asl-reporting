# Summary as of 6th June 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* Access to data is still the most important issue that could limit progress, however in this sprint we now have a possible solution for getting access to the data

## Just Done
* Identified and agreed with supplier a provisional strategy for data migration
* Designed establishment licence "inbox" for establishment users 
* Conducted Workshop and agreed approach for PEL, PPL and PIL licence numbering 

## About to Do/Doing
* Design Licensing and Inspector "inbox" for Establishment licence amendments 
* Test establishment licence "inbox" for establishment users
* Develop software for "view all project licences" page for internal and external users
* Develop software for "request to edit licensed premises" at an establishment
* 

## Things to be aware of
* Agreement of a provisional strategy for data migration strategy with supplier has resulted in a substantial reduction of the project's current monitored risks (see risk management chart)
