# Summary as of 7th February 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Access to the building is still a substantial blocker - this is the sixth week that this has been a problem. Marvell-Consulting have managed to arrange alternative temporary accomodation, but it is not ideal. A security waiver for Lunar house is not possible
* User research is currently not progressing until we can agree dates/approach as outlined in the draft research plan

## Just Done
* Delivered a draft of the research plan
* Members of the team attended a Home Office User Research and Design Meeting at GDS Aldgate offices
* Members of the team gave a talk to other Home Office projects that are using form-filling applications to explore possible commonalities
* Established KPI's and begun baseline measurements 
* Captured actions arising from last week's governance meeting

## About to Do/Doing
* Today we will plan our activities for the next two weeks in sprint planning. 
* The main activities that will be planned will be the research, design prototype activities that have been outline in the draft research plan
* This will likely focus initially on viewing the establishment licence

## Things to be aware of
* Mick Carling will not be working with us after the end of the week
* Project risks have been moved from Jira to Trello (both are issue tracking systems)
