# Summary as of 7th February 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Access to the building is still a substantial blocker - this is the sixth week that this has been a problem. Marvell-Consulting have managed to arrange alternative temporary accomodation, but it is not ideal. A security waiver for Lunar house is not possible.
* User research is currently not progressing until we can agree dates/approach as outlined in the draft research plan

## Just Done
* Members of the team attended a Home Office User Research and Design Meeting
* Members of the team talked to other Home Office projects that are using forms to explore possible commonalities
* Delivered a draft of the research plan
* Agreed KPI's for the project 
* Captured actions arising from last week's governance meeting

## About to Do/Doing
* Today we will plan our activities for the next two weeks in sprint planning. 
* The Sprint plan is an agreement between the development team and the Product Manager
* The main activities that will be planned will be the research, design prototype activieis that have been outlined in the draft research plan
* This will likely focus initially on viewing the establishment licence.

## Things to be aware of
* Mick Carling will not be working with us after the end of the week.
* Project risks have been moved from Jira to Trello (both are issue tracking systems).
