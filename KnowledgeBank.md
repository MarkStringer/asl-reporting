# New ASPeL knowledge bank

If you have any questions about the new ASPeL system, you can post them here, and someone will respond. Over time, it’s expected that this page will be restructured to create a useful Q&A resource.

## Question: How do I take a Screenshot?
### Windows:
The easiest way to take a screenshot in Windows is to press the "windows logo" key - normally at the bottom left of your keyboard and at the same time press the "PrtScr" key - normally at the top left of your keyboard.

### Mac:
Shift + Command + 3 works on most macs but there are more options on newer versions

### Linux Ubuntu:
Pressing the "PrtScr" key results in an image of the whole screen being copied to the clipboard.

## Question: I have experienced a problem while using “New ASPeL” - what do I do?
Describe what steps you took to experience the problem, giving any details that you think might help us fix it.
If possible, try to do these steps again so that you know that you (and we) can "duplicate" the problem i.e. reliably make the same behaviour happen again.

### What browser are you using?
