# Summary as of 4th April 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* Our desks in Lunar House have been reallocated due to underuse
* We are still experiencing administrative difficulties with the security clearance/Lunar House building pass process.
	1. We were not notified when one team member was granted security clearance
	2. Another team member has still not been able to get a Lunar House building pass because security clearance has been granted with the wrong date of birth, despite attempts to correct the error.

## Just Done
