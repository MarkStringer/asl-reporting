# Summary as of 12th September 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* The risk exposure score for the project has increased. We have added the risk "We cannot deal with amends to ASPEL PPLs." We have also substantially increased the risk that "We build the wrong thing because we can't get the information we need or it takes too long to get it." Both of these risks have mitigation strategies in place.

## Just Done
* Designed Approve/Reject a PIL application - inspector view
* Content review of all external facing journeys
* Developmed Convert UI to use HO design system

## About to Do/Doing
* Build applicant-facing PIL application journey
* Test inspector journey for PIL application with inspectors
* Map the "designed universe" - what we've designed so far, and what we still need to design

## Things to be aware of
* A new designer will join the team next week
