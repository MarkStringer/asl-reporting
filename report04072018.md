# Summary as of 4th July 2018 

# Sprint 11 (mid-sprint)

## What's Blocking us / Issues
* We are waiting for security clearance for a new designer.  We expect this to take several more weeks.

## Just Done
* Conducted user research session with more than 50 users from more than 45 establishments, gathering feedback on the PEL amendment process, licence numbers and account permissions
* Produced inbox designs for the establishment user research session
* Developed changes to licensed premises and project directory which were shown at the user research session

## About to Do/Doing
* Analysis of outputs from the establishment user research session
* Design thinking around the statuses for amendment tasks
* Delivery of the end-to-end amendment journey (no middle)

## Things to be aware of
* The risk exposure figure has slightly increased.  This is the result of the removal of one large risk: lack of access to data; and the addition of another risk: sufficient functionality cannot be delivered to turn off ASPel in Aug 2019. This risk has been highlighted now so that all the necessary measures can be put in place to manage and mitigate it.
