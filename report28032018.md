# Summary as of 28th March 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* We are still waiting for security clearance for two members of the team. This is still making arranging meetings in Lunar house difficult for some members of the team.

## Just Done
* Conducted user testing with 10 HOLCS at the HOLTIF meeting at 2MS
* Developed working prototypes of filtering of schedule of premises
* Built a build monitor to aid ongoing code development 

## About to Do/Doing
* Analysis of findings from user testing
* Modifications to design prototypes in light of findings from user testing
* Develop download to  PDF of sorted and filtered establishment data

## Things to be aware of
* The team has two new members - an interaction designer and a software developer
