## Summary
With only a team of three developers working on ASPeL at the moment, the focus remains on building the end-to-end RoPs journeys. This will only become available to users once the entire journey is complete, but behind the scenes we have built the ability to submit a RoP, and we've begun work on the global consolidated access to the RoPs data. This consolidated data will only be accessible by a select few users (the stats team and specific RoPs inspectors). Individual RoPs will be available to anyone who has permission to see the project, and an establishment-level consolidated view will be available to ASRU and relevant establishment users. We'll be working on these components of the RoPs journey, and others, in the coming weeks.
