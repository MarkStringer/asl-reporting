# Summary as of 23rd May 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* Access to data is still a concern.  After the service review this may well become the issue which is the limiting factor on the speed of development for private Beta.
Possible actions and mitigation to address this will be discussed at the next risk management meeting. 

## Just Done
* Attended the ASRU conference in Lancaster
* Developed working software for "View establishment details and view licensed premises (ASRU view)"
* Designed and Tested  Prototype "View all project licences", "People directory" and "Profile pages"

## About to Do/Doing
* View named persons (Establishment user and ASRU view)
* Incorporate design changes for view all project licences based on user testing
* Schedule next round of user research with HOLCs

## Things to be aware of
* The alpha service assessment for the project takes place this Friday 25th May. 
* Amendment prototypes have been tested end to end with ten HOLCs, three licensing users and inspectors present at ASRU conference

## Sample Design Prototype
For the Alpha service assessment we've produced a timeline of the prototypes that we've created and tested with users since the beginning of the project.
